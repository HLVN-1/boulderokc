# Your guide to start indoor bouldering in Oklahoma City!
This will be a website to provide resources to interest people to try out indoor climbing. I started climbing consistently in May 2024 and it's been a source of great joy for me and I want to share the love!

I will be using React, NextJS, and Tailwind to build this app!
